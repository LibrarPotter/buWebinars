# Webinar on software citation/preservation

## Topics to cover 
Getting Credit for Your Code

Citing Code/Software

GitHub/Zenodo Webhook
	

# Are you writing scientific code/software?

## How is your work credited in papers?

## Software can be cited directly
Software papers aren't the only option

## Software is a research product

# How do you cite software?

## Software citations belong in your reference section

## A good citation includes

+ Unique Identifier (e.g. DOI)
+ Software name
+ Author(s)
+ Version number
+ Release date
+ Location/repository
+ Software license (if possible)

## Example Citation

Foreman-Mackey et al. 2014, corner.py, v0.1.1, Zenodo, doi:10.5281/zenodo.11020, as developed on GitHub

## Version control systems like:
+ [GitHub](https://github.com/)
+ [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/)

## Are Not for preservation!

Good citations require more stability

# Want to cite and preserve your code/software?

## Get a DOI for your work

## Digital Object Identifier (DOI):

"A unique and persistent string of characters used to identify a journal article, website, or other item of intellectual property, typically one in digital form."

## Digital repositories that issue DOIs for code/software:
+ [Figshare](https://figshare.com/)
+ [Zenodo](http://zenodo.org)

## GitHub and Zenodo collaboration

Getting a DOI for a GitHub repository through Zenodo is easy

# Overview of getting a DOI through GitHub and Zenodo

## Sign-up for Zenodo using your GitHub account 

(or link your accounts through Zenodo)

## Authorize the webhook

## Go to the GitHub section of Zenodo

## Flip the switch on the GitHub repository you want to cite

## Create a release in GitHub

## Go to the Upload tab in Zenodo

Your new release will be in the right hand section of the screen

## Select your record and update the necessary fields

Most fields will auto-populate based on information in your GitHub repository

## Click **submit** to Mint a DOI!
