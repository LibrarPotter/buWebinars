# Webinar on software preservation/citation

## Topics to cover 
Getting Credit for Your Work

Citing Code

Unique Identifiers
	

# Are you writing scientific code or software?

## How is your work credited in papers?

## Software can be cited directly

Software papers aren't the only option

## Software is a research product

# How do you cite software?

## Pro tip: software citations belong in your reference section <sup>1</sup>

## Software citations on a paper should include

+ Unique Identifier (e.g. DOI)
+ Software name
+ Author(s)
+ Version number
+ Release date
+ Location/repository
+ (recommended but optional) Software license

## Version control systems:
..+ [GitHub](https://github.com/)
..+ [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/)

## Not intended for preservation!
(This means it isn't stable enough for a *good* citation)

# You can get a DOI for a your software

## Digital repositories that issue DOIs for code/software:
+ [Figshare](https://figshare.com/)
+ [Zenodo](http://zenodo.org)

## If you use GitHub, getting a DOI in Zenodo is easy

## Make an account with Zenodo using your GitHub account 

(or link your Zenodo account to GitHub in the linked accounts section on Zenodo)

## Authorize the web hooks

## Go to the GitHub section of Zenodo

## Flip the switch on the GitHub repository you want to preserve

## Create a release in GitHub

## Go to the Upload tab in Zenodo
+ Your new release will be in the right hand section of the screen

## Select your record and update the necessary fields

Most fields will auto-populate based on your GitHub repository

## Click submit to Mint a DOI!

## GitHub has an easy to follow guide called [Making Your Code Citable](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/)
