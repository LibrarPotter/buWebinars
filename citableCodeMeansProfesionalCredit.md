# About Me

## Library Intern

+ Final semester at Simmons College
+ Intern for the [Research Data Management Librarian](http://www.bu.edu/library/profile/thomas-hohenstein/) at Boston University
+ [My website](https://librarpotter.github.io/)

# Webinar on software citation/preservation

## Topics to cover 
Getting Credit for Your Code

Citing Code/Software

GitHub/Zenodo Webhook
	

# Are you writing scientific code/software?

## How is your work credited in papers?

## Software can be cited directly
Software papers aren't the only option

## Software is a research product

# How do you cite software?

## Software citations belong in your reference section

## A good citation includes

+ Unique Identifier (e.g. DOI)
+ Software name
+ Author(s)
+ Version number
+ Release date
+ Location/repository
+ Software license (if possible)

## Example Citation

Foreman-Mackey et al. 2014, corner.py, v0.1.1, Zenodo, doi:10.5281/zenodo.11020, as developed on GitHub

## Version control systems like:
+ [GitHub](https://github.com/)
+ [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/)

## Are Not for preservation!

Good citations require more stability

# Want to cite and preserve your code/software?

## Get a DOI for your work

## Digital Object Identifier (DOI):

"A unique and persistent string of characters used to identify a journal article, website, or other item of intellectual property, typically one in digital form."

## Digital repositories that issue DOIs for code/software:
+ [Figshare](https://figshare.com/)
+ [Zenodo](http://zenodo.org)

## GitHub and Zenodo collaboration

Getting a DOI for a GitHub repository through Zenodo is easy

## Why Trust Zenodo?

+ Managed by the CERN Data Centre
+ Experts on preserving big data
+ Funded by CERN and the EU
